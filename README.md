# Coronavirus_Tweet_Sentiment_Analysis
  AlmaBetter Capstone Project - III

During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter.

This challenge asks you to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets.The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models.
